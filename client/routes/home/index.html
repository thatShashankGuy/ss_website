                <p> Thank you for visiting my little site! My name is Shashank, and I am a software engineer with 6 years of experience in IT and technology. 
                I have worked in various rolesâ€”from server management to full-stack development to RPA automation engineering. 
                In my current role, I work with various cloud services, from AWS to Azure, building, deploying, and maintaining cloud-native applications and pipelines. 
                To learn more about my work history and experience, please refer to my resume.
            </p><p>
                I am based in India. I love video games and reading, and I prefer hardcopies over digital copies. Between gaming and writing software programs, I spend most of my time in front of various screens. 
                I have also developed a liking for writing technical blogs. I am working on few currently and will be uploading them here in blog section; feel free to check them out.
